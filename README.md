## Why its interesting:
The Twelve-Factor App is interesting because it captured, very early on, the essential practices for building scalable, maintainable, and cloud-ready applications. It turned scattered lessons from real-world SaaS development into a clear, universal methodology that applies across languages and platforms. What makes it stand out is how it bridges development and operations.
